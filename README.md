# credit-card-fraud-detection
The goal of our project is to build a Credit Card Fraud Detection System. This system will leverage a robust data pipeline to process transaction data, identify patterns, and detect fraudulent activities using machine learning. By integrating technologies such as Python, MySQL, Apache Beam, and Airflow, the project seeks to provide a scalable and efficient solution to mitigate the risks associated with credit card fraud, thereby enhancing security for financial transactions.
